		* baseline objects, overlap removal, signal objects
	* Tau class now inherits from Lepton
		* I'm not totally sure of this... Need to consider all of the use cases.

		  because the Mll is not really expected to reproduce the Z peak...
			* I added switches to hasZ, etc.  They will ignore taus by default
		* Lepton has variables unnecessary for taus, so we may want to move things around later.
		* I will keep everything backwards compatible for now and not change the Lepton class

	  the lumi, pileup, xsec combined weight
		* getEventWeight() gets the default weight for A-B14

			  but the pileup weights will correspond to A-B14

	  the future.
	* The above has been fixed. You can now inherit from CF. If you don't specify event
	  type it will just save everything under unknown and code shouldn't crash.
