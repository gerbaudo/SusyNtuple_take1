			SusyNtTools::getEventWeight(const Event* evt, float lumi, 
				       		    bool useSumwMap, map<unsigned int, float>* sumwMap)

	* Tagging SusyNtuple-00-00-07

2012-06-23 Steve

		* etc.
	* Removed 'using namespace' statements from headers (grr)
	* Tagging SusyNtuple-00-00-02

2012-06-01 Matt
	* Made cutflow dump all results from three channels
	* Moved getDiLepEvtType(Leptons) to SusyDefs so can be used outside trigger class
	* Note: If you want to inherit methods from Susy2LepCutflow, maybe need to
	  modify the way evt counts are stored. Not pressing right now, but maybe update in
	  the future.
	* The above has been fixed. You can now inherit from CF. If you don't specify event
	  type it will just save everything under unknown and code shouldn't crash.
