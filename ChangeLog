2012-06-18 Steve
	* Added pdfSF weight to Event class, for reweighting 7TeV -> 8TeV
	* Tagging SusyNtuple-00-00-03

2012-06-11 Steve
	* Added TStopwatch for checking processing time

2012-06-11 Steve
	* Updating syntax and conventions for code consistency:
		* SYSTEMATIC -> SusyNtSys
		* NOM -> NtSys_NOM
		* etc.
	* Removed 'using namespace' statements from headers (grr)
	* Tagging SusyNtuple-00-00-02

2012-06-01 Matt
	* Made cutflow dump all results from three channels
	* Moved getDiLepEvtType(Leptons) to SusyDefs so can be used outside trigger class
	* Note: If you want to inherit methods from Susy2LepCutflow, maybe need to
	  modify the way evt counts are stored. Not pressing right now, but maybe update in
	  the future.
	* The above has been fixed. You can now inherit from CF. If you don't specify event
	  type it will just save everything under unknown and code shouldn't crash.

2012-05-31 Matt
	* Tagging SusyNtuple-00-00-01

2012-05-30 Matt
	* Moved directory to Institutes/UCIrvine/SUSYAnalysis
	* Added avgMu, cluster energy, and jet truth label to SusyNt
	* Meff function included in SusyDefs

	* SusyNtuple/Susy3LepCutflow.h: Add new class template for 3 lepton cutflow generation.
	* Root/TrilTrigLogic.cxx: Clone of Steve's TriggerLogic for 3 lepton trigger logic. 
	* SusyNtuple/TrilTrigLogic.h: Clone of Steve's TriggerLogic for 3 lepton trigger logic. 
	* Root/SusyDefs.cxx: Carry over getDataPeriod and getMcPeriod methods needed by the trigger logic. 
	* Root/SusyDefs.cxx: Fix Mt to match its decleration.

	* Removed d0sig cut on electrons to match cutflow
	* Added Susy2LepCutflow which goes up to SR1 cuts

2012-05-18 Matt
	* Added passWhatever(event flag) methods to SusyNtTools to check event flag
	* Modifed passTrigger to take a vector of leptons. More in line with Steve's motif

2012-05-17 Matt
	* Modifed way Met stored, no long inherits from tlv
	* Added lv() method to get tlv of met
